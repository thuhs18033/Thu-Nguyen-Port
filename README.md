## About Me
**Nationality:** Vietnamese.  
**Institution:** Grade 12 - Ngoi Sao Private High School.  
**Media Experience:** I have worked for 4 years in the field of media and communication, flexible in design, content writing, and video production.

## Background & Artist Statement
Coming from a **_non-club Secondary school_**, my exposure to extracurricular activities was supposed to be limited. But since grade 6, owing to the YouTube videos of [Vừng](https://www.youtube.com/@withvung), [Cloudoris](https://www.youtube.com/@cloudoris), [Meichan](https://www.youtube.com/@meichan), etc, I had gradually approached and nurtured a passion for social projects, competition, and studying abroad. That passion led me to the following journey of fighting against prejudice and changed the place where I grew up.

In other words, those influencers had **_changed my life and my community_**. Therefore, I want to give back the same value to my community through working in this field, especially in the **_educational branch_**, which is not just a pursuit that can satisfy my learning aspiration in communication and production but is what has shaped me.

**Category:** Instagram channel  
**Role:** Co-founder  
**Description:** Founded to preserve our high school memories, Phieu Tudors has profoundly impacted both us, the founders, and our community. In Vietnam, there is a stigma around Private High School students, and we have often faced discrimination because of it. To shift this perception, we created this channel to share our positive experiences, showing that attending a Private School is not something to be ashamed of, but rather a prejudice to be challenged.

**Category:** Design  
**Role:** Co-founder, Branding Guidelines Designer  
**Description:** DAM was founded to reduce the bystander effect in school bullying through the STAC Program, recognizing a key insight: students know that bullying must be stopped and victims need support. However, they fear being dragged into conflicts, worry about lacking protection if they intervene, or doubt the effectiveness of their actions. Uncertain about safe and impactful ways to step in, they hesitate. Our program provides clear, effective intervention guidance, empowering students to act with courage and confidence in a safe manner.
